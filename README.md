# Snoopy Social Media

## Overview
Snoopy-Social-Media is a music-focused social media platform where users can post messages and images using localStorage. This web application provides a unique approach to social sharing by keeping all user data client-side.

## Features
- Post text messages to share your thoughts about music
- Upload and share images related to your musical interests
- All data stored locally in the user's browser (localStorage)
- No server-side storage of personal information
- Music-centric social experience
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile use

## Technical Implementation
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- **Storage**: Browser's localStorage API for data persistence
- **Media Handling**: Client-side image processing and storage
- **User Experience**: Lightweight and privacy-focused

## Why localStorage?
Using localStorage instead of a traditional database offers several benefits:
- Enhanced privacy as data never leaves the user's device
- No need for user accounts or authentication
- Works offline once the application is loaded
- Faster performance with no server requests for data
- Reduces server costs and infrastructure requirements

## Limitations
- Data is limited to the user's browser and device
- localStorage has size limitations (typically 5-10MB)
- No sharing between devices or users
- Data can be lost if browser storage is cleared

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Start posting messages and images
4. Your data will be stored in your browser's localStorage

## Browser Compatibility
- Chrome 4.0+
- Firefox 3.5+

## Privacy
Since all data is stored locally, users maintain complete control over their information. No data is transmitted to external servers, ensuring a high level of privacy.

## Future Enhancements
- Import/export functionality to back up user data
